 * thousand rows nobody reads. So the fleet is the row, and its size is the thing
 * worth reading about it.
 *

 * out — the list below this one is paged the same way, and the two never share a
 * cursor, because they are two separate reads of two separate things.

 * A fleet's own settings: the document every agent in it is written from.

 * Saving does not only change what the next agent is created holding. It is written
 * over every agent already in the fleet — their meta documents replaced, the
 * defaults applied over their own settings, including settings their users chose for
 * themselves. That is the point of a fleet setting and it is also the damage it can
 * do, so it is asked for twice: once as a save, once as a sentence saying how many
 * agents it lands on.
 *
 * The write is batched, a few agents per call, for the same reason deleting a fleet
 * is. The settings themselves are stored on the first call, so a run that stops
 * halfway has already changed what the fleet means — the agents behind the cursor
 * are the ones still holding the old document, and saving again finishes the job.

 * The ask for a higher agent limit, as a screen rather than a dialog.

 * and this screen is the only way to make it. So it gets the whole viewport: the
 * page underneath is a list the account has already filled, and nothing on it is
 * worth glancing back at mid-decision.
 *
 * It grants nothing itself. It files a request for a number, which the owner reviews
 * from the admin CLI — so what reaches the account is always a number they chose.
 * The copy says that plainly; a form that looks like a checkout and behaves like a
 * queue is the one thing this screen must not be.
