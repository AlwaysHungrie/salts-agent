/**
 * A stand-in for OpenRouter, wired in as miniflare's `outboundService`.
 *
 * Every `fetch` the Worker or any of its Durable Objects makes goes through here, so
 * the turn loop can be driven end to end — the real `SessionAgent`, the real Think
 * integration, the real AI SDK client, the real transcript and usage writes — with
 * nothing but the provider replaced. No production code knows this exists.
 *
 * Anything that is not OpenRouter is refused with a 503 rather than allowed out. A
 * test suite that can reach the network is a test suite that fails when someone else's
 * service is down, and a Telegram webhook sync firing at a real bot token during a
 * test run is worse than a failure.
 *
 * ## Driving it from a test
 *
 * The mock is a pure function of the request, so tests steer it by what they send
 * rather than by shared mutable state — which cannot work anyway, since the mock runs
 * in Node and the tests run inside workerd. A message beginning with one of these
 * triggers changes the reply:
 *
 * - `!!fail500` — the provider answers 500.
 * - `!!fail401` — the provider rejects the key.
 * - `!!toolcall` — the model calls the `list` tool, then answers using its result.
 *   The second leg is recognised by the tool message the SDK sends back, so the whole
 *   two-step exchange stays deterministic.
 * - `!!schedule` — the model schedules a task a second out, then confirms it. The task
 *   itself comes back through here as an ordinary message, prefixed `[scheduled task]`.
 * - `!!voice` — the model sends a voice note, then confirms it. The speaking call is
 *   answered here too, with a token Ogg Opus file.
 * - `!!draw` — the model draws an image, then confirms it. The drawing call is
 *   answered here too, with a one-pixel PNG.
 * - anything else — the model replies `You said: <message>`.
 *
 * A compaction's summary call is recognised by Think's summary prompt and answered
 * with `FIRST_SUMMARY`, or `UPDATED_SUMMARY` when it folds in an earlier one.
 *
 * Every successful turn reports `COST_PER_TURN` in its usage, so spend accounting is
 * exercised rather than assumed.
